## Motivation
My motivation to start the project was primarily to get an experience in newest version of next.js as a tool for building fullstack application (before considered Node.js). In my career, I was developing projects using Angular 1, Angular 7+, React or Lit, but React is the framework of my choise to grow futher as front-end developer.

Also decided to design my app by following the tips from "Refactoring UI" book by tialwindcss creators. I would like my app to be designed in very modern way and be accessible (semantic HTML and ARIA).

## Getting Started
First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
